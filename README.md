## Unreal Multiplayer Course - Section 3 - Steam Multiplayer

In follow up to our hugely successful [Complete Unreal Engine Developer](http://gdev.tv/urcgithub) course we bring you [Unreal Multiplayer Mastery](http://gdev.tv/uemgithub) - as on featured on [Epic's UE4 blog](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/getting-started-with-unreal-multiplayer-in-cpp).

In this section we teach you to connect your games P2P over steam. This game introduces Unreal's Online Sub-System (OSS) and shows you how to use it with the Steamworks API. By the end of the section, you will be able to connect player through Steam lobbies.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files! The real value is in our huge, high-quality online tutorials that accompany this repo. You can check out the course here: [Unreal Multiplayer Mastery](http://gdev.tv/uemgithub)
